  "moistureTooltip": "Select one or more soil moisture sensors connected to your WaziGate. Hold [CTRL] to select or deselect multiple devices that measure soil tension.",
  "moistureKindTooltip": "Choose the type of soil moisture sensor you are using. Capacitive sensors measure volumetric water content as a percentage (0–100%) or a ratio (0–1), while soil tension sensors measure water potential in kPa or cBar.",
  "tempTooltip": "Select one or more soil temperature sensors connected to your WaziGate. Hold [CTRL] to select or deselect multiple devices.",
  "waterFlowTooltip": "Select the sensor that monitors your pump's water flow, connected to your WaziGate. Only one device can be chosen.",
  "gpsCoordinates": "Provide GPS coordinates to enable automatic retrieval of local meteorological data from online sources.",
  "slopeTooltip": "Specify the slope value to help detect artificial irrigation. Only required if no water flow sensor is added.",
  "irrigationAmountTooltip": "Enter the water volume (in m³) used for each irrigation cycle. If you want to irrigate in liters, divide desired the amount by 1000. Minimum amount is 0.01 m³ (10 liter).",
  "lookAheadTimeTooltip": "Specify how many hours ahead the soil tension forecast should be considered for planning the next irrigation.",
  "startingDateTooltip": "Select the starting date for including sensor data in the model. Allow a brief sensor warm-up period after installation.",
  "maxTimePeriodTooltip": "Set the maximum duration (in days) for which data will be included in the model.",
  "soilTypeTooltip": "Select your field's soil type based on its composition for more accurate analysis.",
  "soilWaterRetentionTooltip": "Enter soil water retention curve data as key-value pairs for model calibration.",
  "pwpTooltip": "Input the soil moisture content value (tension) at which plants are unable to absorb water (permanent wilting point).",
  "fcuTooltip": "Input the maximum soil moisture content (tension) the soil can hold (field capacity upper limit).",
  "fclTooltip": "Input the minimum soil moisture content (tension) the soil can retain (field capacity lower limit).",
  "satTooltip": "Specify the soil moisture content (tension) at full soil saturation.",
  "tensionThresholdTooltip": "Set the automatic irrigation threshold for soil tension, in cBar or hPa.",
  
  "nameTooltip": "Assign a descriptive name to this plot for easy identification within your dashboard.",
  "sensorHumidityTooltip": "Displays the current soil moisture as volumetric water content (VWC), based on converted sensor readings.",
  "sensorTensionTooltip": "Displays the current soil water tension (potential), as measured by the sensor.",
  "sensorTempTooltip": "Shows the current soil temperature value as measured by the sensor.",
  "irrigationTooltip": "Use this option to manually trigger irrigation. If you want to irrigate in liters, divide the desired amount by 1000. Minimum amount is 0.01 m³ (10 liter).",
  "chart_hist_tooltip": "Shows the average soil moisture value from all sensors. Display is limited to 1,000 data points for performance.",
  "chart_train_data_tooltip": "Visualizes all collected data currently used for training the machine learning models.",
  "chart_pred_tooltip": "Displays the latest weekly soil tension predictions generated by the model.",

  "other_key": "Supplementary tooltip text for additional user interface elements."
